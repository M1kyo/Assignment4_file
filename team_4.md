## 2. Key points and challenge

 + ### 2.1 Development role assignment  

 +  ​    A clear assignment of roles helps ensure that everyone knows their tasks and how to contribute to the success of the project.
    ​    However, in the first week when we decided on the role allocation, everyone was not clear about the corresponding part of the role they chose, and some were dissatisfied with it. With the coordination of the team members, everyone finally made it clear. This is very important for the follow-up division of development projects.
    
+ ### 2.2 Project development specification

+ ​    This section includes usage diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams, properties, availability, and security specifications that define the technical and architectural details of the system and are important for development. 
   ​	But after we were all confused about such a complex requirement specification at the beginning, we had a preliminary understanding of the project development after discussing and communicating with each other
   
+ ### 2.3 Team communication and coordination :

+ ​    Poor communication or misunderstanding can lead to project problems. In particular, leaders, product managers, front-end, back-end four aspects of communication. This is the most important communication in the project development, if there is a contradiction will greatly reduce the development efficiency and quality. The second is intra-group communication between front-end and back-end teams. The team leader and group leader should have more responsibility in communication to maintain effective communication.

+ ### 2.4 Project Management and Planning :  

+ ​    A clear project planning and management process is necessary. This includes setting a schedule, assigning tasks, tracking progress, and dealing with risk. Similar to the PSP time table we made in the previous task, this is a good record of the entire development process of our project and clear time allocation. Of course, a project management and planning must be the result of discussion between the leader and team members. 

+ ### 2.5 Quality control and testing : 

+ ​    Ensure that the quality of the product or service delivered by the project meets the requirements, requiring strict testing and quality control. This requires our test team to check the product strictly according to the software development requirements.

## 4. Cooperation and communication

+ ​    In the previous job, the team had a clear division of labor and roles, such as front-end development, back-end development, test engineer, project manager, etc. Each member understands his or her responsibilities, which is more convenient for subsequent development. The specific division of labor structure is as follows.

+ ### 4.1 Group diagram

+ ### 4.2 Collaboration ： 
+ ​    The methods of collaboration used in team development are: using a version control system, Git, so that multiple members can work on the project at the same time, track changes, resolve conflicts, and merge code. Not only that, but we also leverage collaboration platforms and tools, we use GitHub to share code, issue tracking to facilitate collaboration and information sharing among team members.

+ ​    When encountering difficulties, we will discuss within the group first. If we can't solve them, we will report to the leader. At the same time, we will seek help from outside and remotely control the desktop to solve them.
